# Seo_Challenge

## Description

This repository (“SEO_Challenge”) is where we modify + add code to complete the a users story of an application using natural, non-technical language. 

Not only do we work on code and issues here, we also publish this source code which is available to everyone under the standard [URL link](https://moe-op.github.io/seo_challenge/). 


From this exercise, I learned several important principles for writing more organised and maintainable HTML and CSS code:

Semantics in HTML: I learned how to use semantic HTML elements like <header>, <nav>, <main>, and <section> to structure the web page content in a more meaningful way. This improved the accessibility of the page and makes it easier for search engines to understand this content.
Selecting Descriptive Class and ID Names: I managed to learn the importance of selecting descriptive and meaningful class and ID names for elements, making it clear what their purpose is within the HTML.
Commenting in CSS: I learned the value of adding comments to your CSS code to provide context and explain the purpose of specific sections or selectors. This helps me and other developers understand the code when you revisit it later.

Consolidating and Grouping CSS Rules: Grouping related selectors and properties together helps in maintaining and reading the code.
Accessibility: I managed to improved the accessibility of the web page by adding alt attributes to images, which is important for users.
